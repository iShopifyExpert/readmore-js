# readmore-js
Simple "Read More" plugin for HTML5 projects

Simply add the "read-more" class to your HTML object, and a "button" sub-element (wrapped by a "prompt" for good measure)

    <div class="read-more">
        <!-- Content Here -->
        
        <p class="prompt">
            <a class="button" href="#">Read More</a>
        </p>
    </div>
